**CAROUSEL**

Regardless of the implentation style used, utilize the carousel capability to move between pages. This will give the app a more interactive feel. If it's desired to track which screen you're on while being able to slide between pages, use radio buttons horizontally across the bottom or tabs that automatically transition when swiping.

**Roulette**

Search for "Kivy Garden Roulette" to utilize an iOS-style value chooser.

**Animations**

Use the animation module to change theme colors, transition from day to night, go to sleep/wake up, etc.

**Text Effects**

Use markup language to modify text, much like HTML.
